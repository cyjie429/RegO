# RegO

This is the official project of the Region-Based Optimization (RegO) method proposed by our paper titled "Region-Based Optimization in Continual Learning for Audio Deepfake Detection", published on the the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)

### Introduction
Rapid advancements in speech synthesis and voice conversion technologies have introduced new security risks, creating an urgent need for effective audio deepfake detection methods. While current models perform well, their effectiveness often declines when faced with the diverse and evolving nature of real-world deepfakes.
